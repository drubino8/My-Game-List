# My Game List

There are many games I currently play and that I want to play. It is easy for me to lose track of all I want to do. This is my way of tracking my backlog of games I want to complete as well as a way for me to track my battle passes of games I play.

## What This Includes
* Brief intro page listing my favorite games and platforms
* Table with my backlog of games
    * (Currently working on converting all data into a .json file and an API)
* Table with a tracker for my Battle Pass Progress
    * (Currently working on learning APIs and applying an API to track my level automatically)
